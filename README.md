#CodeNotes by Joshua Neeley
This is a collection of notes from various projects. I will add them as time goes by.
A lot of what you will see here will be either small code snippets, structure guides, or even small utilities.

I have had some of this information for quite awhile scribbled in various txt files across my hard drives. So if you end up seeing something that you feel should have been credited to you please let me know mortal.glitch at omegaraven dot com.
